# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-Using-Scikit-Learn
In this project-based course on Coursera, I built and evaluated multiple linear regression models using Python. I used scikit-learn to calculate the regression, while using pandas for data management and seaborn for plotting. The data for this project consists of the very popular Advertising dataset to predict sales revenue based on advertising spending through media such as TV, radio, and newspaper. Built univariate and multivariate linear regression models using scikit-learn, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization with seaborn, evaluate model fit and accuracy using numerical measures such as RÂ² and RMSE, and model interaction effects in regression using basic feature engineering techniques.
